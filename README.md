### **Project Overview**

This project applies K-Means clustering to classify penguins based on their physical characteristics. The dataset includes measurements such as culmen length, depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The goal is to identify distinct groups (potential species) using unsupervised learning.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is penguins.csv, originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.

### Features:
culmen_length_mm – Length of the penguin's bill  
culmen_depth_mm – Depth of the penguin's bill  
flipper_length_mm – Length of the penguin's flipper  
body_mass_g – Mass of the penguin in grams  
sex – Male or Female

### **Project Steps**

### Data Preprocessing:

1-Load the dataset  
2-Handle missing values (if any)  
3-Standardize the numerical features  

### K-Means Clustering:  
1-Standardize the dataset  
2-Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method  
3-Apply K-Means to classify the penguins  
4-Results and Interpretation:  
5-Visualize cluster assignments  
6-Analyze the effectiveness of clustering based on physical characteristics
